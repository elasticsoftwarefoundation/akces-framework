# Comprehensive Analysis of the Akces Framework

## Introduction

The Akces Framework is a sophisticated event sourcing and CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) implementation built on Apache Kafka. It provides a complete infrastructure for building distributed, event-driven applications with a clear separation between write and read concerns.

## Core Purpose and Values

Akces addresses several key challenges in distributed systems:

1. **Event Sourcing Implementation**: Provides a comprehensive event sourcing implementation where all changes to application state are captured as a sequence of events.

2. **CQRS Architecture**: Enforces clean separation between command (write) and query (read) responsibilities.

3. **Scalability**: Leverages Kafka's partitioning for horizontal scaling of aggregates.

4. **Privacy By Design**: Built-in GDPR compliance through transparent encryption of personally identifiable information (PII).

5. **Schema Evolution**: Sophisticated schema management with backward compatibility checks.

## Architecture Overview

Akces is organized into five main modules, each with distinct responsibilities:

### 1. API Module (`akces-api`)
Defines the core interfaces and annotations that make up the programming model.
- `Aggregate` and `AggregateState` interfaces
- Command and event interfaces
- Handler annotations for commands and events
- Query model interfaces

### 2. Shared Module (`akces-shared`)
Contains common utilities and shared functionality:
- Protocol record definitions for Kafka communication
- GDPR compliance utilities (encryption/decryption)
- Schema registry integration
- Serialization/deserialization support

### 3. Runtime Module (`akces-runtime`)
Implements the core event sourcing infrastructure:
- Aggregate runtime for handling commands and events
- State repositories (RocksDB-based and in-memory)
- Command handling pipeline
- Event sourcing mechanics

### 4. Client Module (`akces-client`)
Provides client-side functionality for sending commands and receiving responses:
- Command sending with synchronous and asynchronous APIs
- Service discovery for routing commands
- Schema validation

### 5. Query Support Module (`akces-query-support`)
Implements the query side of CQRS:
- Query model runtime
- Database model support (JDBC, JPA)
- Event handling for query models
- State hydration

## Key Components and Patterns

### Aggregate Pattern

At the core of Akces is the concept of aggregates, which are domain entities that:
- Encapsulate business logic
- Respond to commands
- Emit domain events
- Maintain state through event sourcing

```java
@AggregateInfo(value = "Wallet", version = 1)
public final class Wallet implements Aggregate<WalletState> {
    @CommandHandler(create = true)
    public Stream<DomainEvent> create(CreateWalletCommand cmd, WalletState isNull) {
        return Stream.of(new WalletCreatedEvent(cmd.id()));
    }
    
    @EventSourcingHandler(create = true)
    public WalletState create(WalletCreatedEvent event, WalletState isNull) {
        return new WalletState(event.id(), new ArrayList<>());
    }
}
```

### Command Handling

Commands are processed through a pipeline that:
1. Validates the command structure (using JSON Schema)
2. Routes the command to the appropriate aggregate
3. Processes the command to produce events
4. Applies those events to update the aggregate state
5. Persists the events and updated state

```java
@CommandInfo(type = "CreateWallet", version = 1)
public record CreateWalletCommand(@AggregateIdentifier String id, String currency) implements Command {
    @Override
    public String getAggregateId() {
        return id();
    }
}
```

### Event Sourcing

The event sourcing mechanism:
1. Captures all state changes as immutable events
2. Stores events in Kafka topics, partitioned by aggregate ID
3. Rebuilds aggregate state by replaying events
4. Uses RocksDB to maintain efficient state snapshots

```java
@DomainEventInfo(type = "WalletCreated", version = 1)
public record WalletCreatedEvent(@AggregateIdentifier String id) implements DomainEvent {
    @Override
    public String getAggregateId() {
        return id();
    }
}
```

### GDPR Compliance

Akces provides sophisticated GDPR compliance through:
1. `@PIIData` annotation to mark sensitive fields
2. Transparent encryption/decryption during serialization
3. Key management through Kafka topics
4. Context-based encryption to secure personal data

```java
public record AccountState(
    @AggregateIdentifier String userId,
    String country,
    @PIIData String firstName,
    @PIIData String lastName,
    @PIIData String email
) implements AggregateState {
    @Override
    public String getAggregateId() {
        return userId();
    }
}
```

### Query Models

For efficient reads, Akces implements:
1. Query models updated via domain events
2. State hydration from event streams
3. Caching mechanisms for efficient access
4. Support for custom query model implementations

```java
@QueryModelInfo(value = "WalletQuery", version = 1, indexName = "Wallets")
public class WalletQueryModel implements QueryModel<WalletQueryModelState> {
    @QueryModelEventHandler(create = true)
    public WalletQueryModelState create(WalletCreatedEvent event, WalletQueryModelState isNull) {
        return new WalletQueryModelState(event.id(), List.of());
    }
}
```

### Database Models

For integration with databases:
1. Database models updated from domain events
2. Support for JDBC and JPA
3. Transactional updates with exactly-once semantics
4. Partition-aware offset tracking

```java
@DatabaseModelInfo(value = "WalletDatabase", version = 1)
public class WalletDatabaseModel extends JdbcDatabaseModel {
    @DatabaseModelEventHandler
    public void handle(WalletCreatedEvent event) {
        jdbcTemplate.update("INSERT INTO wallets (wallet_id) VALUES (?)", event.id());
    }
}
```

### Process Managers

For coordinating complex workflows:
1. Process managers to orchestrate multi-step processes
2. Process state tracking to maintain workflow state
3. Event-driven process advancement
4. Error handling and compensation logic

```java
@AggregateInfo(value = "OrderProcessManager", version = 1)
public class OrderProcessManager implements ProcessManager<OrderProcessManagerState, OrderProcess> {
    @CommandHandler
    public Stream<BuyOrderCreatedEvent> placeBuyOrder(PlaceBuyOrderCommand command, OrderProcessManagerState state) {
        // Initiate a multi-step process
    }
    
    @EventHandler
    public Stream<DomainEvent> handle(AmountReservedEvent event, OrderProcessManagerState state) {
        // Continue the process
    }
}
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Partition-Based Processing

Akces utilizes Kafka's partitioning for scalability:
- Aggregates are distributed across partitions based on their ID
- Each partition is processed independently
- Partitions can be rebalanced across nodes as needed
- State is maintained efficiently per partition

### Transactional Processing

Commands are processed transactionally:
- Kafka transactions ensure atomicity
- State updates are coordinated with event publishing
- Exactly-once semantics are preserved
- Failures result in transaction rollbacks

### Schema Management

Schema evolution is handled through:
- Schema registry integration (Confluent Schema Registry)
- JSON Schema validation for commands and events
- Automatic schema compatibility checks
- Version management for backward compatibility

### State Management

Aggregate state is managed efficiently:
- RocksDB for persistent state storage
- Transactional state updates
- Optimistic concurrency control
- In-memory caching for performance
