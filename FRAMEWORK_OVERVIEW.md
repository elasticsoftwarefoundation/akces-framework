# Comprehensive Review of Akces Framework

After carefully analyzing the codebase, I can provide an updated comprehensive overview of the Akces Framework, building upon and refining the existing FRAMEWORK_OVERVIEW.md.

## Main Purpose

Akces is a sophisticated event-sourcing and CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) framework built on Apache Kafka. Its primary purpose is to provide developers with a structured approach to building distributed, event-driven applications with a clear separation between write and read concerns. The framework handles the complex infrastructure required for event-sourcing while allowing developers to focus on domain logic.

Key goals of the framework include:
- Simplifying the implementation of event-sourced applications
- Providing a scalable architecture for distributed processing
- Enforcing clean separation between command and query responsibilities
- Supporting privacy-by-design through GDPR-compliant data handling
- Enabling schema evolution with backward compatibility checks

## Core Architectural Components

Akces is organized around several key architectural components that work together:

### 1. Aggregate Module

The aggregate module is responsible for handling commands and maintaining state through event sourcing. Key components include:

- **Aggregates**: Domain entities that encapsulate business logic and respond to commands
- **Aggregate States**: Immutable representations of aggregate state
- **Command Handlers**: Process commands and emit domain events
- **Event Sourcing Handlers**: Apply events to update aggregate state
- **Event Handlers**: React to events to produce further events
- **Event Bridge Handlers**: Connect events from one aggregate to commands on another

The runtime leverages Kafka partitioning for horizontal scaling, with each partition handling a subset of aggregates based on their IDs.

### 2. Command Processing

The command processing pipeline includes:

- **Command Bus**: Routes commands to appropriate aggregates
- **Command Validation**: Schema-based validation using JSON Schema
- **Command Execution**: Transactional processing that produces events
- **Command Response Handling**: Collects and returns resulting events

### 3. Query Model System

For the read side, Akces provides:

- **Query Models**: Domain-specific projections optimized for reading
- **Query Model States**: Immutable state representations 
- **Query Model Event Handlers**: Update query models based on domain events
- **Database Models**: Persistent storage models updated from events
- **JDBC/JPA Integration**: Support for different database technologies

### 4. Process Managers

To orchestrate complex workflows:

- **Process Managers**: Coordinate interactions between multiple aggregates
- **Process States**: Track the status of long-running processes
- **AkcesProcess**: Domain-specific process representation

### 5. GDPR Compliance Layer

For handling sensitive data:

- **PIIData Annotation**: Mark fields containing personal data
- **GDPR Context**: Encryption/decryption context for an aggregate
- **Transparent Serialization**: Automatic encryption/decryption during serialization
- **Key Management**: Secure handling of encryption keys

## Technical Implementation Details

### Event Sourcing Implementation

The event sourcing mechanism in Akces follows these principles:

1. **Immutable Events**: All domain events are immutable records of facts
2. **Event Storage**: Events are stored in Kafka topics, partitioned by aggregate ID
3. **State Reconstruction**: Aggregate state is derived by replaying events
4. **State Snapshots**: RocksDB is used to maintain efficient state snapshots

The `KafkaAggregateRuntime` class manages the event sourcing logic, handling:
- Command processing and validation
- Event application to state
- State persistence
- Event publishing

### Partitioning and Scalability

Akces achieves scalability through:

1. **Partition-based Processing**: Each instance processes specific partitions
2. **Consistent Hashing**: Aggregate IDs are consistently hashed to partitions
3. **Parallel Processing**: Multiple partitions can be processed concurrently
4. **Atomic Transactions**: Kafka transactions ensure atomicity of operations

The `AggregatePartition` class handles partition-specific processing, managing:
- Command handling for a partition
- Event processing for a partition
- State management for a partition

### Schema Evolution

Akces provides sophisticated schema evolution through:

1. **Schema Registry Integration**: Works with Confluent Schema Registry
2. **Schema Versioning**: Clear versioning of all commands and events
3. **Compatibility Checking**: Ensures backward compatibility
4. **JSON Schema Generation**: Automatic schema generation from classes

The `KafkaSchemaRegistry` class handles schema management, providing:
- Schema registration and validation
- Compatibility checking
- Schema versioning support

### GDPR Compliance Implementation

The GDPR compliance layer uses:

1. **AES Encryption**: For sensitive data fields
2. **Jackson Serialization Integration**: Custom serializers/deserializers
3. **Key Management**: Secure storage of encryption keys in Kafka
4. **Annotation-based Marking**: Easy identification of sensitive fields

### Query Model Implementation

The query model system provides:

1. **Event-driven Updates**: Query models updated via events
2. **State Hydration**: Efficient state loading and caching
3. **Database Integration**: Support for JDBC and JPA databases
4. **Partition-aware Processing**: Scalable across nodes

## Module Structure

Akces is organized into several Maven modules:

1. **api**: Core interfaces and annotations defining the programming model
   - Aggregate, Command, and Event interfaces
   - Handler annotations for commands and events
   - Query model and database model interfaces

2. **runtime**: Implements the core event sourcing runtime
   - Aggregate runtime for command/event handling
   - State repositories (RocksDB/in-memory)
   - Kafka integration
   - Command handling pipeline

3. **shared**: Common utilities and shared functionality
   - Protocol records for communication
   - GDPR compliance utilities
   - Serialization/deserialization support
   - Schema registry integration

4. **client**: Client-side library for interacting with aggregates
   - Command sending
   - Response handling
   - Discovery of available aggregates

5. **query-support**: Support for query models and database models
   - Query model runtime 
   - Database model support
   - Event handling for models
   - State hydration

## Programming Model

Akces provides a clean, annotation-based programming model:

### Defining Aggregates

```java
@AggregateInfo(value = "Wallet", version = 1)
public class Wallet implements Aggregate<WalletState> {
    @CommandHandler(create = true)
    public Stream<DomainEvent> create(CreateWalletCommand cmd, WalletState isNull) {
        // Command handling logic
    }
    
    @EventSourcingHandler(create = true)
    public WalletState create(WalletCreatedEvent event, WalletState isNull) {
        // Event application logic
    }
}
```

### Defining Commands and Events

```java
@CommandInfo(type = "CreateWallet", version = 1)
public record CreateWalletCommand(@AggregateIdentifier String id, String currency) implements Command {
    @Override
    public String getAggregateId() {
        return id();
    }
}

@DomainEventInfo(type = "WalletCreated", version = 1)
public record WalletCreatedEvent(@AggregateIdentifier String id) implements DomainEvent {
    @Override
    public String getAggregateId() {
        return id();
    }
}
```

### Defining Query Models

```java
@QueryModelInfo(value = "WalletQuery", version = 1, indexName = "Wallets")
public class WalletQueryModel implements QueryModel<WalletQueryModelState> {
    @QueryModelEventHandler(create = true)
    public WalletQueryModelState create(WalletCreatedEvent event, WalletQueryModelState isNull) {
        // Create logic
    }
}
```

### GDPR Annotation

```java
public record UserInfo(
    @AggregateIdentifier String userId,
    @PIIData String firstName,
    @PIIData String lastName,
    @PIIData String email
) implements AggregateState {
    // ...
}
```

## Runtime Components

The key runtime components include:

1. **AkcesAggregateController**: Manages aggregate partitions and lifecycle
2. **AkcesClientController**: Handles command sending and response processing
3. **AkcesQueryModelController**: Manages query model state hydration
4. **AkcesDatabaseModelController**: Handles database model updates
