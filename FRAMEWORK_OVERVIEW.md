# Comprehensive Analysis of the Akces Framework - Updated Overview

## Introduction

The Akces Framework is a sophisticated event sourcing and CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) implementation built on Apache Kafka. It provides a comprehensive infrastructure for building distributed, event-driven applications with a clear separation between write and read concerns.

## Core Purpose and Values

Akces addresses several key challenges in distributed systems:

1. **Event Sourcing Implementation**: Provides a complete event sourcing framework where all changes to application state are captured as an immutable sequence of events.

2. **CQRS Architecture**: Enforces clean separation between command (write) and query (read) responsibilities for better scalability and performance.

3. **Partition-Based Scalability**: Leverages Kafka's partitioning for horizontal scaling of aggregates, allowing applications to scale with increasing load.

4. **Privacy By Design**: Built-in GDPR compliance through transparent encryption of personally identifiable information (PII).

5. **Schema Evolution**: Sophisticated schema management with backward compatibility checks to support evolving domain models.

6. **Process Management**: First-class support for process managers to orchestrate multi-step business processes across aggregates.

## Architecture Overview

Akces is organized into five main modules, each with distinct responsibilities:

### 1. API Module (`akces-api`)
Defines the core interfaces and annotations that make up the programming model:
- `Aggregate` and `AggregateState` interfaces
- Command and event interfaces with marker annotations
- Handler annotations (`@CommandHandler`, `@EventHandler`, etc.)
- Query model interfaces and annotations

### 2. Shared Module (`akces-shared`)
Contains common utilities and shared functionality:
- Protocol record definitions for Kafka communication
- GDPR compliance utilities with encryption/decryption
- Schema registry integration for JSON schema validation
- Serialization/deserialization support with Protocol Buffers
- RocksDB utilities for efficient state management

### 3. Runtime Module (`akces-runtime`)
Implements the core event sourcing infrastructure:
- Aggregate runtime for processing commands and events
- State repositories (RocksDB-based and in-memory)
- Command handling pipeline with validation
- Event sourcing mechanics for state reconstruction
- Kafka partition management for distributed processing

### 4. Client Module (`akces-client`)
Provides client-side functionality for command submission:
- Command sending with synchronous and asynchronous APIs
- Service discovery for routing commands to the correct aggregate
- Schema validation and compatibility checking
- Command response handling

### 5. Query Support Module (`akces-query-support`)
Implements the query side of CQRS:
- Query model runtime for maintaining read models
- Database model support (JDBC, JPA) for persistence
- Event handling for updating query models
- State hydration for efficient retrieval
- Caching for improved read performance

## Key Components and Patterns

### Aggregate Pattern

At the core of Akces is the concept of aggregates, which are domain entities that:
- Encapsulate business logic within consistency boundaries
- Respond to commands by validating and processing them
- Emit domain events representing facts that have occurred
- Maintain state through event sourcing mechanisms

```java
@AggregateInfo(value = "Wallet", version = 1)
public final class Wallet implements Aggregate<WalletState> {
    @CommandHandler(create = true)
    public Stream<DomainEvent> create(CreateWalletCommand cmd, WalletState isNull) {
        return Stream.of(new WalletCreatedEvent(cmd.id()));
    }
    
    @EventSourcingHandler(create = true)
    public WalletState create(WalletCreatedEvent event, WalletState isNull) {
        return new WalletState(event.id(), new ArrayList<>());
    }
}
```

### Command Handling

Commands are processed through a pipeline that:
1. Validates the command structure using JSON Schema
2. Routes the command to the appropriate aggregate partition
3. Processes the command to produce domain events
4. Applies those events to update the aggregate state
5. Persists both events and updated state to Kafka topics

```java
@CommandInfo(type = "CreateWallet", version = 1)
public record CreateWalletCommand(@AggregateIdentifier String id, String currency) implements Command {
    @Override
    public String getAggregateId() {
        return id();
    }
}
```

### Event Sourcing

The event sourcing mechanism:
1. Captures all state changes as immutable events in Kafka
2. Stores events in partitioned topics for efficient processing
3. Rebuilds aggregate state by replaying events
4. Uses RocksDB to maintain efficient state snapshots
5. Handles event upcasting for schema evolution

```java
@DomainEventInfo(type = "WalletCreated", version = 1)
public record WalletCreatedEvent(@AggregateIdentifier String id) implements DomainEvent {
    @Override
    public String getAggregateId() {
        return id();
    }
}
```

### GDPR Compliance

Akces provides sophisticated GDPR compliance through:
1. `@PIIData` annotation to mark sensitive fields
2. Transparent encryption/decryption during serialization
3. Key management through dedicated Kafka topics
4. Context-based encryption to secure personal data
5. Separation of encryption keys from data for better security

```java
public record AccountState(
    @AggregateIdentifier String userId,
    String country,
    @PIIData String firstName,
    @PIIData String lastName,
    @PIIData String email
) implements AggregateState {
    @Override
    public String getAggregateId() {
        return userId();
    }
}
```

### Query Models

For efficient reads, Akces implements:
1. Query models updated via domain events
2. State hydration from event streams
3. Caching mechanisms for efficient access
4. Projection-based read models optimized for specific query patterns

```java
@QueryModelInfo(value = "WalletQuery", version = 1, indexName = "Wallets")
public class WalletQueryModel implements QueryModel<WalletQueryModelState> {
    @QueryModelEventHandler(create = true)
    public WalletQueryModelState create(WalletCreatedEvent event, WalletQueryModelState isNull) {
        return new WalletQueryModelState(event.id(), List.of());
    }
    
    @QueryModelEventHandler
    public WalletQueryModelState creditWallet(WalletCreditedEvent event, WalletQueryModelState state) {
        return new WalletQueryModelState(
            state.walletId(),
            state.balances().stream()
                .map(balance -> {
                    if (balance.currency().equals(event.currency())) {
                        return new WalletQueryModelState.Balance(
                            balance.currency(),
                            balance.amount().add(event.amount()),
                            balance.reservedAmount()
                        );
                    }
                    return balance;
                })
                .toList()
        );
    }
}
```

### Database Models

For integration with traditional databases:
1. Database models updated from domain events
2. Support for JDBC and JPA persistence
3. Transactional updates with exactly-once semantics
4. Partition-aware offset tracking for reliable processing

```java
@DatabaseModelInfo(value = "WalletDatabase", version = 1)
public class WalletDatabaseModel extends JdbcDatabaseModel {
    @DatabaseModelEventHandler
    public void handle(WalletCreatedEvent event) {
        jdbcTemplate.update("INSERT INTO wallets (wallet_id) VALUES (?)", event.id());
    }
    
    @DatabaseModelEventHandler
    public void handle(WalletCreditedEvent event) {
        jdbcTemplate.update(
            "UPDATE wallet_balances SET amount = ? WHERE wallet_id = ? AND currency = ?",
            event.newBalance(),
            event.id(),
            event.currency()
        );
    }
}
```

### Process Managers

For coordinating complex workflows:
1. Process managers to orchestrate multi-step processes
2. Process state tracking to maintain workflow state
3. Event-driven process advancement
4. Error handling and compensation logic

```java
@AggregateInfo(value = "OrderProcessManager", version = 1)
public class OrderProcessManager implements ProcessManager<OrderProcessManagerState, OrderProcess> {
    @CommandHandler
    public Stream<BuyOrderCreatedEvent> placeBuyOrder(PlaceBuyOrderCommand command, OrderProcessManagerState state) {
        String orderId = UUID.randomUUID().toString();
        
        // Reserve funds first - send command to Wallet aggregate
        getCommandBus().send(new ReserveAmountCommand(
            state.userId(),
            command.market().quoteCurrency(),
            command.quantity().multiply(command.limitPrice()),
            orderId
        ));
        
        return Stream.of(new BuyOrderCreatedEvent(
            state.userId(),
            orderId,
            command.market(),
            command.quantity(),
            command.limitPrice(),
            command.clientReference()
        ));
    }
    
    @EventHandler
    public Stream<DomainEvent> handle(AmountReservedEvent event, OrderProcessManagerState state) {
        if (state.hasAkcesProcess(event.referenceId())) {
            OrderProcess process = state.getAkcesProcess(event.referenceId());
            return Stream.of(new BuyOrderPlacedEvent(
                state.userId(),
                process.orderId(),
                process.market(),
                process.quantity(),
                process.limitPrice()
            ));
        }
        return Stream.empty();
    }
}
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Partition-Based Processing

Akces utilizes Kafka's partitioning for scalability:
- Aggregates are distributed across partitions based on their ID
- Each partition is processed independently by a dedicated thread
- Partitions can be rebalanced across nodes dynamically
- State is maintained efficiently per partition using RocksDB

### Transactional Processing

Commands are processed transactionally:
- Kafka transactions ensure atomic updates
- State updates are coordinated with event publishing
- Exactly-once semantics are preserved
- Failures result in transaction rollbacks
- Consistent offset management for reliable processing

### Schema Management

Schema evolution is handled through:
- Schema registry integration (Confluent Schema Registry)
- JSON Schema validation for commands and events
- Automatic schema compatibility checks
- Version management for backward compatibility
- Support for upcasting to handle schema changes

### State Management

Aggregate state is managed efficiently:
- RocksDB for persistent state storage with high performance
- Transactional state updates with rollback capability
- Optimistic concurrency control
- In-memory caching for performance
- State snapshots to avoid full event replay
