- All code must be written in Java 25 and use Java 25 language contstruct whenever possible
- When working on a Task to extend or refactor (part of) the framework, always create a detailed Plan first. Store the plan in the /framework-developer/plans/<task> folder
- Confirm the plan with the Architect and only execute on it when specifically asked to do so
- Use the frameworks and libraries that are present in the project, don't add any new frameworks and libraries without prior consent (in the plan)
