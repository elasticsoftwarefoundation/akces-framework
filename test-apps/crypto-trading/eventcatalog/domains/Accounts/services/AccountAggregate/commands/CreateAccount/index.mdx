## Overview

The CreateAccount command initiates the creation of a new user account in the system. This is the first step in the user onboarding process and establishes the basic identity of the user in the platform.

## Command Handler

The command handler validates the input and produces an `AccountCreatedEvent` when successful. The handler is responsible for ensuring all required fields are provided before creating the account.

```java
@CommandHandler(create = true, produces = AccountCreatedEvent.class, errors = {})
public Stream<AccountCreatedEvent> create(CreateAccountCommand cmd, AccountState isNull) {
    return Stream.of(new AccountCreatedEvent(cmd.userId(), cmd.country(),
                                           cmd.firstName(), cmd.lastName(), cmd.email()));
}
```
