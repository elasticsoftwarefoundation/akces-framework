## AKCES Framework

AKCES Framework is a robust, event-driven architecture framework designed to simplify the development of scalable and resilient distributed systems. Built on core principles of event sourcing and CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation), it provides developers with a comprehensive toolkit for building modern applications that can handle complex business requirements.

### Core Features

- **Event Sourcing**: Store all changes to application state as a sequence of events for complete audit history and reliable state reconstruction
- **Command Handling**: Structured approach to processing user actions and business operations
- **Aggregate Management**: Maintain consistency boundaries with an intuitive aggregate pattern implementation
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built for horizontal scaling to handle growing workloads efficiently
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Seamless integration between system components using events
- **Versioning Support**: Robust handling of schema evolution through event upcasting

### Technical Foundation

The framework is built on Java with Spring Boot integration, providing a familiar environment for enterprise developers. It supports various storage backends and messaging systems, allowing teams to leverage existing infrastructure while adopting event-driven patterns.

### Philosophy

AKCES Framework emphasizes developer productivity without sacrificing system robustness. By providing clear patterns for complex architectural challenges, it enables teams to focus on business logic rather than infrastructure concerns.
