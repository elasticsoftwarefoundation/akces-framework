# AKCES Framework Analysis

## Overview

The AKCES Framework is a robust event-driven architecture framework designed for building scalable and resilient distributed systems. It implements core principles of event sourcing and Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) to provide developers with a comprehensive toolkit for building modern applications.

## Core Architecture

### 1. Event Sourcing Implementation

The framework implements event sourcing as its foundational pattern, where:

- All changes to application state are stored as a sequence of events
- The current state is reconstructed by replaying these events
- Events are immutable facts that have occurred in the system
- The event store (Kafka) serves as the source of truth

The implementation uses Kafka as the event store, with dedicated topics for commands, domain events, and aggregate states. This provides a reliable, scalable foundation for event-driven systems.

### 2. Aggregate Pattern

Aggregates are the core domain entities in the framework:

- They encapsulate business logic within consistency boundaries
- Each aggregate has a unique identifier and maintains its own state
- Commands are processed by aggregates, which emit domain events
- State is reconstructed by replaying events through event sourcing handlers

The framework provides annotations like `@AggregateInfo` and `@CommandHandler` to define aggregates and their behavior:

```java
@AggregateInfo(
        value = "Account",
        stateClass = AccountState.class,
        generateGDPRKeyOnCreate = true,
        indexed = true,
        indexName = "Users")
public final class Account implements Aggregate<AccountState> {
    @CommandHandler(create = true, produces = AccountCreatedEvent.class, errors = {})
    public Stream<AccountCreatedEvent> create(CreateAccountCommand cmd, AccountState isNull) {
        return Stream.of(new AccountCreatedEvent(cmd.userId(), cmd.country(), cmd.firstName(), cmd.lastName(), cmd.email()));
    }
    // Other command handlers...
}
```

### 3. Command Processing Pipeline

Commands follow a well-defined processing pipeline:

1. Commands are sent via the `AkcesClient` interface
2. They are routed to the appropriate aggregate service via Kafka
3. The `AkcesAggregateController` processes commands and dispatches them to aggregates
4. Command handlers validate and process commands, emitting domain events
5. Events are applied to update the aggregate state
6. Both events and updated state are persisted to Kafka

### 4. State Management

The framework provides multiple state repository implementations:

- `RocksDBAggregateStateRepository`: Uses RocksDB for efficient, persistent state storage
- `InMemoryAggregateStateRepository`: In-memory implementation for testing or simple scenarios

State is serialized/deserialized using Jackson with custom serializers for handling PII data.

## Technical Components

### 1. Kafka Integration

The framework deeply integrates with Kafka:

- Uses Kafka as the event store and message broker
- Implements custom producer and consumer factories
- Manages partitioning for scalable processing
- Handles offset management for reliable processing
- Uses transactions for atomic operations

The `AggregatePartition` class manages a single partition of an aggregate's events, providing isolation and scalability.

### 2. Schema Management

The framework includes a robust schema registry:

- Validates commands and events against JSON schemas
- Supports schema evolution through versioning
- Handles compatibility checking between versions
- Provides upcasting mechanisms for evolving schemas

### 3. GDPR and PII Data Handling

One of the standout features is the sophisticated GDPR compliance mechanism:

- Uses `@PIIData` annotation to mark sensitive fields
- Implements transparent encryption/decryption during serialization
- Manages encryption keys through a dedicated Kafka topic
- Provides context-based encryption to secure personal data
- Separates encryption keys from data for better security

Example of PII data handling:

```java
@AggregateStateInfo(type = "Account", version = 1)
public record AccountState(
    @NotNull String userId,
    @NotNull String country,
    @NotNull @PIIData String firstName,
    @NotNull @PIIData String lastName,
    @NotNull @PIIData String email,
    Boolean twoFactorEnabled
) implements AggregateState {
    // Implementation...
}
```

The `EncryptingGDPRContext` class handles the encryption and decryption of PII data:

```java
@Override
@Nullable
public String encrypt(@Nullable String data) {
    if (data == null) {
        return null;
    }
    try {
        logger.trace("Encrypting data for aggregateId '{}' with algorithm {} and encryptionKey (hash) {}",
                aggregateId,
                encryptingCipher.getAlgorithm(),
                HexFormat.of().formatHex(encryptionKey));
        return Base64.getUrlEncoder().encodeToString(encryptingCipher.doFinal(data.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8)));
    } catch (IllegalBlockSizeException | BadPaddingException e) {
        throw new SerializationException(e);
    }
}
```

### 4. Modular Architecture

The framework is organized into several modules:

- **API Module**: Core interfaces and annotations
- **Runtime Module**: Implementation of the event sourcing infrastructure
- **Client Module**: Client-side components for interacting with the framework
- **Shared Module**: Common utilities and shared functionality
- **Query Support Module**: Support for the query side of CQRS
- **EventCatalog Module**: Tools for documenting and exploring events

## Design Patterns and Principles

### 1. Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)

The framework implements CQRS by:

- Separating command processing (write model) from queries (read model)
- Using different data models for commands and queries
- Optimizing each side for its specific requirements

### 2. Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

The framework embraces DDD concepts:

- Aggregates as consistency boundaries
- Domain events as the core communication mechanism
- Ubiquitous language through clear naming conventions
- Bounded contexts through service separation

### 3. Hexagonal Architecture

The framework follows principles of hexagonal architecture:

- Core domain logic is isolated from infrastructure concerns
- Adapters connect the domain to external systems
- Dependencies point inward toward the domain

## Strengths

1. **Robust Event Sourcing**: The implementation of event sourcing is thorough and well-designed, providing a solid foundation for building event-driven systems.

2. **GDPR Compliance**: The framework's approach to handling PII data is sophisticated and comprehensive, making it well-suited for applications with strict privacy requirements.

3. **Scalability**: The use of Kafka and partitioning enables horizontal scaling to handle growing workloads efficiently.

4. **Schema Evolution**: The framework provides robust mechanisms for evolving schemas over time, which is crucial for long-lived systems.

5. **Modularity**: The codebase is well-organized into modules with clear responsibilities, making it easier to understand and extend.

6. **Testing Support**: The framework includes tools for testing aggregates and command handlers, with in-memory implementations for repositories.

## Areas for Improvement

1. **Documentation**: While there appears to be some documentation, more comprehensive guides and examples would help developers adopt the framework more easily.

2. **Learning Curve**: The framework implements complex architectural patterns that may have a steep learning curve for developers unfamiliar with event sourcing and CQRS.

3. **Dependency Management**: The framework has dependencies on specific technologies like Kafka and RocksDB, which may limit its applicability in some contexts.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Command Handling

Commands are processed through a pipeline that includes:

1. Validation against JSON schemas
2. Routing to the appropriate aggregate
3. Execution of command handlers
4. Generation of domain events
5. Updating aggregate state
6. Persisting events and state

The `CommandHandler` annotation defines how commands are processed:

```java
@Target({ElementType.METHOD})
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
public @interface CommandHandler {
    boolean create() default false;
    Class<? extends DomainEvent>[] produces();
    Class<? extends ErrorEvent>[] errors();
}
```

### Event Sourcing

The event sourcing mechanism:

1. Stores all domain events in Kafka
2. Reconstructs state by replaying events
3. Uses event sourcing handlers to apply events to state
4. Supports upcasting for schema evolution

### State Management

State is managed through:

1. State repositories (RocksDB or in-memory)
2. Serialization/deserialization with Jackson
3. Transaction management for atomic operations
4. Offset tracking for reliable processing
